# With the success of Atom, it's really difficult to choose keybindings that
# will not enter in conflict whit anyone else's packages, so I let this file
# empty to set your own keybindings.
# For you informations, here's an exemple of my keybindings for coffee-check

# ".platform-linux atom-text-editor:not([mini]), .platform-win32 atom-text-editor:not([mini])":
#   "ctrl-k ctrl-c": "coffee-check:check"
#
# ".platform-darwin atom-text-editor:not([mini])":
#   "cmd-k cmd-c": "coffee-check:check"

'atom-workspace':
  'unset': 'coffee-check:check'
